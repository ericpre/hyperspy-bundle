# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.

# of the sidebar.

# If youâ€™re hosting your documentation on ReadTheDocs, you should consider
# adding an explicit placement for their ethical advertisements. These are
# non-tracking advertisements from ethical companies, and they help
# ReadTheDocs sustain themselves and their free service.
#
# Ethical advertisements are added to your sidebar by default. To ensure
# they are there if you manually update your sidebar, ensure that the
# sidebar-ethical-ads.html template is added to your list. For example:

html_sidebars = {
    "**": ["search-field.html", "sidebar-nav-bs.html", "sidebar-ethical-ads.html"]
}
